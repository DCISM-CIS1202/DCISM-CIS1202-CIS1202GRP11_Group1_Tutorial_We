          <h1>What</h1>
          <p>
            He is well known for his discoveries in optics (white light
            composition) and mathematics (calculus), it is his formulation of
            the three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics,
            for which he is most famous.

          <h1>When</h1>
          <p>
            He was born on December 25, 1642 and Died on March 20 , 1727 Sir
            Isaac Newton worked in many areas of mathematics and physics. He
            developed the theories of gravitation in 1666 when he was only 23
            years old. In 1686, he presented his three laws of motion in the
            “Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis.”

          <h1>Why</h1>
          <p>
            The importance of Newton lies in his formulation of the laws of 
            motion and universal gravitation, which transformed our understanding 
            of how objects move and interact. He also developed calculus, providing 
            a powerful mathematical tool for solving complex problems in science. 
            Additionally, his work in optics helped shape the study of light and 
            color, cementing his legacy as a foundational figure in science.

            <h1>Inertia</h1>
            <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
            <div class="inertia-information">
              <div> 
                <p>
                  An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in 
                  motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  This principle is described by Newton’s First Law, also known as the law of inertia. 
                  It states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line 
                  unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. This resistance 
                  to changes in motion is what we call <strong><i>Inertia</i></strong>.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/inertia.png" class="law-img">
                <p>
                  Inertia is the property of an object to stay at rest or continue moving at a constant 
                  velocity unless influenced by an external force. Without this tendency, the world would 
                  be chaotic. Imagine if the furniture in your bedroom suddenly started moving on its own—such 
                  unpredictability would make it impossible, or even dangerous, to spend time in such a space.

                  Explanation: The book's inertia keeps it stationary until a force acts on it.

            <h1>Acceleration</h1>
            <h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
            <div class="acceleration-information">
              <div> 
                <p>
                  Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not
                  balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the
                  net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly
                  upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon
                  an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased,
                  the acceleration of the object is decreased. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The Second law states: <br> <br> 
                  The acceleration of an object is connected to the force which is acting on it. The object speeds up due to
                  the force acting on it.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/acceleration.png" class="law-img">
                <p>
                  This is why this law has a formula:

                  a = F / m,

                  in which:

                  a — is the acceleration that is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2). It means that if an object
                  accelerates at 1 m/s2, its speed is increasing by 1 meter per second every second.
                  F — is a force that is measured in newtons (yes, he was so cool they named this unit of measurement in his
                  honor)
                  m — is an object’s mass that is measured in kilos.

                  same speed. <br>
                  Explanation: The stroller’s acceleration depends on its mass and the force applied.

                  Explanation: The lighter tennis ball requires less force to accelerate, while the heavier basketball resists
                  motion more due to its greater mass.

                  Explanation: Greater force increases the ball’s acceleration, demonstrating the direct relationship between
                  force and motion.

          <h1>Action-Reaction</h1>
          <h2>Newton's Third Law</h2>
          <div class="action-reaction-information">
            <div> 
              <p>
                Newton's Third Law tells us that forces in nature always come in pairs: for every action, there’s 
                an equal and opposite reaction. If object A pushes or pulls on object B, object B pushes or pulls 
                back on object A with the same strength but in the opposite direction. In short, forces don’t exist 
                in isolation—they’re the result of interactions between objects.
              </p>
              <img src="assets/action-reaction.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px; height: 500px; width: 400px; border-radius: 20px;">
              <p>
                What Newton means by it is that there are always two forces acting on each other at the same time 
                in the opposite directions. And there are no isolated forces — it is a package deal. The first force 
                comes from outside. The second one is the reaction on the first one, which acts back on the object 
                exerting that force. These two forces are always equal, and in the end, they compensate each other.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                This law signifies a particular symmetry in nature: forces always occur pairs, and one body cannot 
                exert a force on another without experiencing a force itself. In the next few sections, let us learn 
                Newton’s third law in detail. That is why this law is called the the law of action and reaction.
